How To Set Up A Mobile Device For Security And Master One's Online Data, Part 2: Equipment

This guide will explain how to set up a mobile device for maximum security without significantly degrading the experience of using the device and provide suggestions on how digital technology can be used generally to improve one's overall security while retaining one's privacy - which may act as a foundation to ultimately enable technology to be used more productively.

The guide may be utilised by someone who is just getting started online or an existing web user who is looking for a fresh start to improve their practices around privacy and security. Common issues such as having too many passwords or being overly-exposed to big service providers are given a remedy. While iOS users may find some of the information provided useful, frequently steps require that one be using an Android device (not the least of which because Android allows apps to be side-loaded).
