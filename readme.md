# How To Set Up A Mobile Device For Security And Master One's Online Data, Part 1: Principles

This guide will explain how to set up a mobile device for maximum security without significantly degrading the experience of using the device and provide suggestions on how digital technology can be used generally to improve one's overall security while retaining one's privacy - which may act as a foundation to ultimately enable technology to be used more productively.

The guide may be utilised by someone who is just getting started online or an existing web user who is looking for a fresh start to improve their practices around privacy and security. Common issues such as having too many passwords or being overly-exposed to big service providers are given a remedy. While iOS users may find some of the information provided useful, frequently steps require that one be using an Android device (not the least of which because Android allows apps to be side-loaded).

## Principles

These principles underpin the steps and recommendations in this multi-part guide so are being provided first. As general principles, they will likely be longer-lasting than any individual suggestion.

1. A person should only ever have to remember two passwords. These passwords should never be revealed and easy to change if necessary.
2. It should be quick and easy to change email addresses.
3. A well-designed product is both easy-to-use and secure.
4. It is important for one's smartphone to be secure.
5. Provided that it is secure, it is usually advisable to keep one's smartphone close at hand.
6. One's phone should be kept at maximum charge as much as possible and, when using one's phone, it is better to be draining the battery of a power bank than that of the phone.
7. One's default policy (with regards to phone settings and notifications) should be to maximise security and minimise disturbances. With that as a baseline, one can then consider each feature individually in terms of whether to make an allowance.
8. Unless accessing the service uninterrupted is critical, one's default policy with regards to activating a new paid subscription should be to cancel immediately after subscribing. This is almost always the same as simply paying for a single billing period rather carries significantly less financial risk.
